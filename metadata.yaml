description: This 1911 novel about a twelve-year-old boy who falls in with a band
  of bloodthirsty pirates is a maritime thriller on par with Robert Louis Stevenson
  or Rudyard Kipling. At first Jim loves the excitement of his new lifestyle, but
  soon finds out he's in over his head! The author, who spent part of his youth keeping
  journals of his own steamship and windjammer travels, brings to life the beauty
  and peril of the oceans.
